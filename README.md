# Soft-robotic-actuator-control-adafruit-
This code was written to a project to contol the movement and light of a single actuator soft robot. You can find the project here :https://agostonbalazs.com/genezis/#szerzet----creature-01
The sysetm is based on Jonas Jørgensen soft robotics toolkit project on https://softroboticstoolkit.com/
